TODO:  
    copypaste.cpp
        high value target - a proof of concept plugin to allow copy-pasting in DF; does both terrain and buildings/constructions
    creaturemanager.cpp
        modify skills and labors of creatures, kill creatures, etc; impressive but I suspect most functions implemented elsewhere

In progress:
    hotkey-notes.lua
        prints list of hotkeys with name and jump position
